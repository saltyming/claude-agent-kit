# Git Preferences

> Installed by claude-agent-kit. This file is user-owned (`claude-agent-kit-custom:git-prefs`): uninstall and upgrade keep it. The configure step asks for each value, the agent fills in a value still `unset` after asking you, and you can edit any value by hand.

`unset` means no value is set yet. The agent asks before the first commit or PR that needs the value, then writes your answer here.

## Commit signing

**unset**

Values: `default` (leave git's own configuration alone) | `no-gpg-sign` (pass `--no-gpg-sign` on `git commit`, `git commit --amend`, `git revert`, and `git cherry-pick`).

## Model attribution

**unset**

Values: `on` (keep the harness's default co-author trailer and PR footer) | `off` (no `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming a model, no "Generated with ..." footer, no line identifying the agent).

## Commit message format

**unset**

Values: `conventional` (`<type>(<area>): <subject>`, a blank line, then a body; types `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`; the area is optional) | `repository` (match the recent `git log` of the repository you are in) | your own format, written here.

## PR body format

**unset**

Values: `summary-test-plan` (a `## Summary` bullet list, then a `## Test plan` checklist of concrete verification steps) | `repository` (follow the repository's PR template or recent PRs) | your own format, written here.

## Branch naming

**unset**

Values: `descriptive` (`feat/...`, `fix/...`; do not push a worktree branch name as is) | `repository` | your own rule, written here.

## Repository overrides

When a repository's own convention differs from a value above, the agent asks which one to follow there and records the answer on one line: `- <repository root or remote>: <what to follow>`.

## Notes

Free-form. Anything written here is a live rule.
